Drum Kit
Overview
This project is a simple Drum Kit created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The drum kit allows users to interact with buttons corresponding to letters that play specific drum sounds.

Features
Interactive Buttons: Each button responds with a visual animation and a sound when clicked or pressed.
Fire Effect Animation: The buttons are wrapped in a container that has a glowing, animated border simulating a fire effect.
Smooth Transitions: Buttons change color on hover and scale up when clicked to enhance the user experience.
Fully Responsive: The layout is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
Stylized Background: A background image is used, and it is positioned and sized to cover the whole screen, adding visual appeal.
Key Files
index.html: Contains the structure and layout of the drum kit interface.
style.css: Handles all the styling, animations, and visual effects for the drum kit.
app.js: JavaScript file responsible for adding functionality, such as playing sounds and handling user input.
How It Works
HTML Structure: The buttons are organized within div containers, and each button has a unique letter associated with it.
CSS Animations: The buttons have fire-like glowing animations on their borders, which change in intensity using keyframe animations.
Button Interaction: On hover, buttons change their background to a gradient color. When clicked, the buttons scale up with a smooth transition effect.
